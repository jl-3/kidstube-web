# KidsTube Project

YouTube for Kids is generally speaking a great idea, but it has two major issues:

1. It is not available in some countries (in Ukraine specifically).
2. You cannot limit what it displays to your kid. And some videos are quite stupid or are just an advertising that's just annoying.

To solve these limitations I've decided to make up a small "KidsTube" website for my own son where me and my wife could safely add any video from YouTube that we approve and categorize it for our children to watch only the accepted cartoons.

It's quite simple website that's written in Laravel and available publicly at http://kidstube.space/
In case anyone want's to use it for his kids, please, feel free to do so. You may even register an account for yourself to add some more videos.
